    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Steak and chips is a classic dish that perfectly balances the rich, savory flavors of a juicy, tender steak with the crispy, golden texture of freshly cooked fries. The steak, often seasoned simply with salt and pepper, is grilled or pan-seared to perfection, allowing its natural flavors to shine through. The accompanying chips, whether thick-cut or shoestring, are fried until  
crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, providing a delightful contrast to the succulent meat. This dish is often served with a side of tangy ketchup or a creamy dipping sauce, enhancing the overall experience.</p>  
    <p>Choosing steak for this dish adds a hearty and indulgent element that elevates the meal to a satisfying comfort food experience. The beef's robust flavor profile pairs wonderfully with the simplicity of the chips, creating a harmonious blend of textures and tastes. Whether enjoyed as a casual meal or a special treat, steak and chips offer a timeless combination that appeals to meat lovers and food enthusiasts alike.</p>
    <p>Preparation Time: 30 minutes</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ribeye steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into fries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Spread the cut potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Toss to coat evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>While the fries are baking, season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill pan or skillet over high heat. Once hot, add the steaks and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or longer if you prefer your steak more well-done. Remove from heat and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the steaks alongside the crispy fries, with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce on the side if desired.</li>
        <li> Enjoy your delicious steak and chips!</li>
    </ol>
