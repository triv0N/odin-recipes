    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken fajitas are a vibrant, crowd-pleasing dish that brings together tender strips of marinated chicken, colorful bell peppers, and onions, all sizzling hot from the pan. The secret lies in the marinade — a mix of lime, garlic, and spices that infuse the chicken with bold, zesty flavor. Served with warm tortillas, a touch of sour cream, and fresh salsa or guacamole, chicken fajitas offer the perfect balance of smoky, tangy, and savory elements in every bite.</p>
    <p>Choosing chicken over beef or pork gives fajitas a lighter, fresher character without losing their satisfying richness. The lean meat absorbs the spices beautifully, creating a dish that feels both hearty and wholesome. Combined with crisp vegetables and bright toppings, chicken fajitas deliver that comforting Tex-Mex warmth while keeping things balanced, flavorful, and endlessly adaptable to personal taste.</p>
    <p>Preparation Time: 20 minutes</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>8 small flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Sour cream, salsa, and guacamole for serving (optional)</li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, chili powder, ground cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper, and lime juice. Mix well to create the marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced chicken breasts to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well coated. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for more flavor).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the marinated chicken slices. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add a little more olive oil if needed. Add the sliced bell peppers and onions. Sauté for about 5-6 minutes until they are tender-crisp and slightly caramelized.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked chicken to the pan with the vegetables. Stir everything together and cook for an additional 2 minutes to combine the flavors.</li>
        <li>Warm the flour tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave.</li>
        <li>To serve, spoon the chicken and vegetable mixture onto each tortilla. Add sour cream, salsa, and guacamole if desired.</li>
        <li> Roll up the tortillas and enjoy your delicious chicken fajitas!</li>
    </ol>
